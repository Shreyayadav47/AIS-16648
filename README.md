Day 2

Notebook 1 - If conditions

Equals: a == b
not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b

Notebook 2 - If elif condition

The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
In this example a is equal to b, so the first condition is not true, but the elif condition is true, so we print to screen that "a and b are equal".

Notebook 3 - If else condition
The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

Notebook 4 - for loop

Notebook 5 - while loop
