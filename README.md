Day 2 

Notebook 1 - If conditions
1) Equals: a == b
2) not Equals: a != b
3) Less than: a < b
4) Less than or equal to: a <= b
5) Greater than: a > b
6) Greater than or equal to: a >= b

Notebook 2 - If elif condition 
1) The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
2) In this example a is equal to b, so the first condition is not true, but the elif condition is true, so we print to screen that "a and b are equal".

Notebook 3 - If else condition 
1) The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

3) The break Statement
4) The continue Statement
5) The range() Function
6) Else in For Loop
